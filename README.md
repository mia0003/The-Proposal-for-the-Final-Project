## Description/Summary

In this game, you collect ingredients in a grocery store and face many obstacles. There are multiple outcomes, so your input can result in a different outcome. You can get three meal options: tacos, spaghetti, or hamburgers. Depending on the meal you get, it either gives you a more extended playthrough or a shorter one (as the ingredients vary for each meal).

In this game, you face many obstacles trying to obtain ingredients in a grocery store and are ultimately tasked with making choices and successfully obtaining all the items. For the basics, you are tasked with three meals of those ingredients: tacos, spaghetti, or hamburgers. Depending on which meal you get, it amounts to how long the gameplay will essentially be (tacos being the most prolonged and hamburgers being the shortest). 

For my functions, I have quite a few. Initially, in my proposal for the project, I said that I would attempt to do an inventory function that lists the items needed after an item is obtained, a random function that randomizes output for the player, and a time module. With the project completed, I could not achieve the time module. Instead, I ‘replaced’ it with a function that writes out the gameplay, letter for letter, and a colorful text display in which the title and ending statement are typed onto the terminal in rainbow colors. Also, I made two print features: if you obtain an item, a smiley face will appear as a result, and if you’re unsuccessful in obtaining an item, a skull will appear on the other hand. You can face five obstacles trying to get ingredients within the grocery store, and an additional one is only available under certain circumstances. It is called the revenge storyline!

I proposed this project to be very interactive, enabling players to make their own choices and ultimately run the game themselves. I achieved that, but there definitely could have been things I could have worked on. For example, I could have organized my code better. While I had comments explaining what each section did, I started adding new parts towards the top, not making my code chronological as I dived deeper into my code.
