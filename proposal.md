## Description
This final project will be a game in which the player is given a grocery list from which they have to obtain the items. They will face many obstacles in the grocery store, in which they have to decide how to overcome them. This game will teach players how to be efficient in the grocery store and how to make the ultimate decision to move on to the next stage of the game.

## Features
- Feature 1 - random.choice() 
	- Instead of the choices being giving a signified result, I will use this given feature to have the result of the players answer as a randomized outcome. Doing so, will make it fun for the players, in the event they decide to play the game again, and for me as well, as I don't necessarily know what outcome will be given based on the answer I decide to choose in the given obstacle of the game.
- Feature 2 - inventory system
	- As you obtain each item in the following game, it will be displayed for the player to see. Doing so will enable the player to understand what items are collected and missing from the grocery list.
- Feature - time module 
	- This feature will give the player a certain amount of time to choose an answer. In a grocery store, we face obstacles when finding needed items and making quick decisions. I want the game to be representative of that. 

## Challenges
- Upon starting the game, have an intro image appear before the player chooses choices (also have images appear based on the decision they choose (like check-mark if they succesfully obtain item and/or an X if they were unable to do so))
- Understanding how to pinpoint where exactly to draw on the given screen in regards to the challenege #1 point.
- Have multiple grocery lists so that each game can be played differently based on the items chosen for the given game. Doing so will challenge me, as I need to be more thorough in my additional functions.
  
## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- I want the game to be enjoyable for the player interacting with it, wanting them to play it a few more times after their first time playing. I want the player to find the game funny and ultimately enjoy facing the obstacles I provide them in the given game.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The given game must provide obstacles and choices the player has to choose from. In the game, there needs to be problems, trial and error, which the player has to understand and learn as the game progresses.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Goal 1 - set up the main functions and brainstorm/figure out the additional functions needed for the overall game.
  2. Goal 2 - begin with the main function, setting up the 'start' of the game.

- Week 2
  1. Goal 1 - start going through each additonal function, and possible brainstorm what else to add to the given game.
  2. Goal 2 - Begin sketching (before coding) what images will appear on the screen based on the player's choices. <-- then start coding so.

- Week N (Final)
  1. Goal 1 - Finish up code in which images appear based on actions + clean-up code and make sure it looks neat.
  2. Goal 2 - Play the game and see if anything is off, if so, look through code and see what needs to be fixed.
