Title - Dinner Disaster: Ingredient Hunt
URL for Demonstration: 
Description/Explanation:
In this game, you collect ingredients in a grocery store and face many obstacles. There are multiple outcomes, so your input can result in a different outcome. You can get three meal options: tacos, spaghetti, or hamburgers. Depending on the meal you get, it either gives you a more extended playthrough or a shorter one (as the ingredients vary for each meal).
Initially, when planning on making the game, I said I would do a time module, but I faced some issues and had to replace that idea. With that, I learned the slow_print function in which my game writes it along as it is being coded, and I did a rainbow feature on the text specific to the title and the text in which you complete the game!

For the features, there is an inventory popup that lists what items you still need after you pick an item and face an obstacle. As I stated in the previous paragraph, rainbow, and slow_print features exist. There are five obstacles you can face when obtaining features, and they are entirely randomized; another obstacle is not listed with the others, as it only applies under the story of the taco, depending on the store you choose and how you carry your belongings. Itâ€™s called the revenge storyline!
